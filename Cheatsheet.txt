with Block
A with block can be used to open a file:

with open(path_to_file) as f:
    # do something with f (the file) here

The with block will automatically close the file when the block is exited, cleaning up resources.

.read() Method
You can use the .read() method to read the contents of a file into a string:

# f is a file object
file_contents = f.read()
